# TX-794-Logistics-System

## Introduction
 This project was made to improve the quality of life and make paperwork less of a chore for the TX-794. It was made as a 
 tool to improve workflow and overall efficency of an increasingly slow and painful system that we have in place now. It 
 also has features that if utilized properly can be used to further improve the corps. Not only will it make logistics run 
 smoother, it will also make keeping track of personel easier and quicker than the previous decentralized system.
